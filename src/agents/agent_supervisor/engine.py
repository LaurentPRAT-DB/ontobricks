"""Supervisor engine - assess complexity, then dispatch to the right engine.

This is the in-process brain the Agent Bricks Supervisor delegates to. Given a
task (only ``"mapping"`` — see below) plus the domain's metadata and ontology,
it runs the deterministic ``ComplexityAssessor``, picks the engine, and
invokes it via ``AgentClient``.

Engine selection (deterministic):

* "mapping" - the genuine two-engine choice. PGE: ``agent_mapping_pge``;
  simple: ``agent_auto_assignment`` (the original single-agent engine from
  ``master``). This is what the complexity score routes between.

The mapping selection can be forced via ``engine_override`` for callers that
already know which engine they want (e.g. the supervisor acting on its own
routing decision).

An ``"ontology"`` task used to dispatch to the deprecated one-shot
``agent_owl_generator`` bridge (``AgentClient.run_owl_generator`` ->
``agents.agent_owl_generator.engine.run_agent``). That bridge contained the
post-generation pitfall-rewrite loop the three-stage Generate design
(``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-20-three-stage-ontology-generate-design.md``)
replaces; it was never wired to a production Model Serving endpoint (only
``task="mapping"`` is exposed via ``responses_agent.py``) and has been removed
outright rather than left dormant. Ontology generation now goes exclusively
through the staged workflow (``back.objects.ontology.GenerateWorkflow`` +
``agents.agent_owl_generator.staged``), which this supervisor does not front.
